## Overview

A portfolio of work is a powerful tool in job hunting, allowing individuals to showcase their skills and talents to potential employers. Employers rely on portfolios to assess an applicant's abilities and aptitude for part-time or full-time positions. An effective portfolio goes beyond presentation, highlighting a candidate's strongest work and demonstrating their expertise. 

Students with portfolios containing deployed web applications tend to have remarkable success in their career search. These live projects demonstrate their ability to conceptualize, develop, and deploy applications for public use. Having several deployed projects is often seen as a minimum requirement for securing an initial interview at esteemed companies, highlighting a candidate's competence and practical experience.
